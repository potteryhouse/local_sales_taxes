Local Sales Taxes
Plugin for Zen Cart 1.3.9 &amp; 1.5.x

This plugin adds the support for local sales tax zones. In
the United States a local sales tax is a additional tax
levied by the county or city in addition to the tax levied
by a state.

You should consult your local tax authority for tax advice
as it relates to your business.

As this plug-in handles additional tax zones some features
of "Modules/Shipping Modules" do not work in the same way
after installation of this module.
